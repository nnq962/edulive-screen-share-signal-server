# WebRTC Library Upgrade Plan

## Current Situation
- **Current Library:** `com.mesibo.api:webrtc:1.0.5` (2021-2022)
- **Status:** Outdated, lacks modern features
- **Audio Solution:** Working via WebSocket (separate from WebRTC)

## Upgrade Options

### Option 1: JitPack Library (RECOMMENDED ✅)
**Tính khả thi: 90%**

```gradle
// In app/build.gradle
dependencies {
    // Remove old library
    // implementation 'com.mesibo.api:webrtc:1.0.5'
    
    // Add new library
    implementation 'com.github.codecrunchers-x:WebRTC-Android-Library:v1.0.32006'
}

// In settings.gradle or root build.gradle
repositories {
    google()
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Latest WebRTC (M106+)
- ✅ Easy to integrate
- ✅ Regularly updated
- ✅ No build required

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Need to test API compatibility
- ⚠️ Might need minor code changes

---

### Option 2: Manual AAR from GitHub
**Tính khả thi: 80%**

```gradle
// Download AAR from: https://github.com/rno/WebRTC/releases
// Put in: app/libs/libwebrtc-123.0.0.aar

dependencies {
    implementation(files("libs/libwebrtc-123.0.0.aar"))
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Full control over version
- ✅ Offline-friendly

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Manual update process
- ⚠️ Larger repo size

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Testing (Week 1)
1. Create a new branch: `upgrade-webrtc`
2. Update dependencies
3. Fix any compilation errors
4. Test screen sharing functionality

### Phase 2: Validation (Week 2)
1. Test on multiple devices
2. Test different Android versions
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Check for memory leaks

### Phase 3: Deployment (Week 3)
1. Merge to main branch
2. Deploy to production
3. Monitor for issues

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues & Solutions

**Issue 1: API Breaking Changes**
```kotlin
// Old API (Mesibo)
peerConnectionFactory.createVideoSource(...)

// New API (might be)
peerConnectionFactory.createVideoSource(isScreencast = true)
```
**Solution:** Check migration guide, test thoroughly

**Issue 2: Screen Capture Issues**
**Solution:** Keep current screen capture code, should be compatible

**Issue 3: Performance Degradation**
**Solution:** Benchmark before/after, rollback if needed

## Future Enhancement: WebRTC Audio Track

**ONLY CONSIDER AFTER UPGRADE IS STABLE**

Once upgraded to modern WebRTC, you COULD:
1. Access WebRTC source code modifications
2. Implement AudioPlaybackCapture directly into WebRTC
3. Get better audio/video sync

But realistically:
- Current WebSocket solution works great
- No strong reason to change
- Adds complexity

## Decision Matrix

| Factor | Keep Mesibo | Upgrade to JitPack | Build from Source |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Effort** | 0 hours | 4-8 hours | 40-80 hours |
| **Risk** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Performance** | Old | Modern | Modern |
| **Maintenance** | Easy | Easy | Hard |
| **Features** | Limited | Modern | Full Control |
| **Recommendation** | ❌ No | ✅ YES | ❌ No |

---

## Final Recommendation

### Immediate (Now):
✅ **KEEP WebSocket audio solution** - It works perfectly!

### Short-term (1-2 months):
✅ **UPGRADE to JitPack library** for:
- Better performance
- Modern WebRTC features
- Security updates
- Future-proofing

### Long-term (6+ months):
❓ **MAYBE consider WebRTC audio track** if:
- You need perfect lip sync
- Latency becomes critical
- You have bandwidth to maintain custom builds

## Testing Checklist

After upgrade, test these:
- [ ] Screen sharing starts correctly
- [ ] Video quality is good
- [ ] Control commands work
- [ ] Reconnection works
- [ ] Multiple devices can connect
- [ ] WebSocket audio still works
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] No crashes
- [ ] Battery usage acceptable
- [ ] Network usage acceptable
